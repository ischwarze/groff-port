To make groff manual page output as similar as possible to mandoc(1)
output, the following two groff features have been disabled by
default in man(7) and mdoc(7) manual pages: adjustment of text to
the right margin and hyphenation.

The following chamges have been made to fix regressions in the 1.23 release:
 * The title in the mdoc(7) page header line is set in roman,
   not in italic font.
 * Manual page cross references generated with the mdoc(7) .Xr macro
   are set in roman, not in italic font.

To suit the taste of OpenBSD developers, one mdoc(7) formatting
detail has been changed with respect to the upstream distribution:
Title lines use an n-dash, not an m-dash between the manual page
name and the manual page description.
