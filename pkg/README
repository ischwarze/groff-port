To make groff manual page output as similar as possible to mandoc(1)
output, the following two groff features have been disabled by
default in man(7) and mdoc(7) manual pages: adjustment of text to
the right margin and hyphenation.

The following chamges have been made to fix regressions in the 1.23 release:
 * The base paragraph indentation in manual pages is set to 5n, not to 7n.
 * The title in manual page header lines is set in roman,
   not in italic font.
 * Manual page names marked up with the mdoc(7) .Nm macro are always
   set in bold, not in roman font, including in the NAME section.
 * Manual page cross references are set in roman, not in italic font.
 * Literal text in mdoc(7) is set in constant width roman,
   not in bold font.

To suit the taste of OpenBSD developers, one mdoc(7) formatting
detail has been changed with respect to the upstream distribution:
Title lines use an n-dash, not an m-dash between the manual page
name and the manual page description.
