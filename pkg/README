| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To make groff manual page output as similar as possible to mandoc(1)
output, the following two groff features have been disabled by
default in man(7) and mdoc(7) manual pages: adjustment of text to
the right margin and hyphenation.

To suit the taste of OpenBSD developers, one mdoc(7) formatting
detail has been changed with respect to the upstream distribution:
Title lines use an n-dash, not an m-dash between the manual page
name and the manual page description.
